## 📋 What is Streamliner-AI?

Streamliner-AI is a software tool that helps you easily create short video clips from Kick streamer moments. It works by watching live streamers, finding the exciting parts of their videos, and turning those into vertical clips. These clips are made to fit perfectly on social media like TikTok. The tool then posts these clips automatically so you don't need to do anything by hand.

This means you can save time, get more attention on social media, and never miss sharing viral streamer highlights.
